Coding WOWCAT may be slower progress and may not be worked on for a while, I had ran a command that accidentally bypassed school security, I had not caused any damage but to make my princible not mad, I deleted the files, I will update on Github but due to not being able to run on computer, it may be buggy, and since I have no budget (Not asking for money) I cannot hire testers, besides, this is just a fun project, thanks for reading
